# JavaScript Kata - Part 1: Library

Code kata in JavaScript where you have to write a library of books and magazines.

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

## Topic

You have to implement an abstracted and simple library system.

## Frame conditions

1. You have exact __2.5 hours__ of time - __no minute longer__.
   If you reach this time limit stop your work immediately.
   It is one part of the kata to respect this time limit.

2. There are no restrictions on how to use the provided time.
   If you want to code the entire time, take a break or a cigaret - it’s up to you.

3. There is no right or wrong. Also you don't need to "complete" the task. The amount of code/functionalities depends on your experience level. Of course the more you do the best for your evaluation, as long as you keep good code quality.

4. This is a real world situation. You are allowed to consult the Internet, use every library you want, call a friend ...
   **BUT:** You are not allowed to do pair programming.
   **AND** If you have already done this kata before to have a look at your previous implementation.

5. Keep the following __priorities__ in mind while you implementing - in the mentioned order:
   1. Code quality
   2. Usage of object oriented methods
   3. Functionality

6. Given resources:
   > **Hint:** There is a reason why there are so many books and authors in german with [umlauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_umlaut).

   * [`authors.csv`](data/authors.csv): Contains authors with its `email`, `firstName` and `lastName`.
   * [`books.csv`](data/books.csv): Contains books with its `title`, `description`, one or more `authors` and an `isbn`.
   * [`magazines.csv`](data/magazines.csv): Contains magazines with its `title`, one or more `authors`, a `publishedAt` and an `isbn`.

<!-- Develop your code based on [ECMAScript 2018 (ES2018)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/index.html). -->

## Tasks

* [Main tasks](#main-tasks)
* [Optional tasks](#optional-tasks)

### Main tasks

1. Print out all books and magazines with all their details sorted by `title`. (This sort should be done for books and magazines together.)

2. Print out all books and magazines with all their details (with a meaningful output format). Implement an interactive user interface for it.
   > **Hint**: Do not call `printBooks(...)` first and then `printMagazines(...)` 😉

3. Find a book or magazine by its `isbn`. Implement an interactive user interface for it.

4. Find all books and magazines by their `authors`’ email. Implement an interactive user interface for it.



### Optional tasks

> **Hint:** Optional means optional.

1. Write Unit tests for one or more methods.

## Procedure

1. Get the code. There are several ways for it:
   1. With fork (makes it possible to preserve your work):
      1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/wundertax/javascript-kata/fork)
      2. Clone this fork to your computer:
         ```bash
         git clone <your github url>
         # Example: git clone https://github.com/blaubaer/nodejs-kata-1.git
         ```

   2. Clone this repository with local branch:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/wundertax/javascript-kata.git
      git checkout -b run-<yourname>-<iteration number>
      # Example: git checkout -b run-blaubaer-1
      ```

   3. Just download it from [here](https://github.com/wundertax/javascript-kata/archive/master.zip)

2. Open in your favorite text editor/IDE.
   > **Hint**: We recommend [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

3. Start the kata.

4. Discuss with your friends and/or colleges your solution.

5. Repeat after some days/weeks.

## FAQ

##### How to run your application?

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

2. Run `start` script:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   
   This command will run dev server. After this the project is accessible on [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

##### What's the structure of the boilerplate?

> **Important!** `react` and `react-dom` are already included in `package.json`. If you want to use other libraries/frameworks, you have to install and include them manually.

1. [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) for building and bundling:
   * `.js` and `.css` files work out of the box
   * entry point is `src/index.js` file
   * bundle is being written in `dist/main.js`

2. [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

3. [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) for code checking.

3. [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) for hacking:
   * configured to serve content of `dist`, `data` and `static` folders. If you run server, CSV files are gonna be available from the root, e.g. `data/authors.csv` will be served over [http://localhost:9000/authors.csv](http://localhost:9000/authors.csv)
   * supports live reload

4. [`babel`](https://babeljs.io/) for code transpiling:
   * preconfigured `preset-env` and `preset-react`

> **Hint:** if you prefer using another build tool/bundler/test suite/etc: feel free to modify whatever you need.

##### How to lint your code?

For code check:
```bash
npm run lint
```

To fix the linting errors:
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

##### How to run your tests?

```bash
npm run test
```
